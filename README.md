# Mock Blog Website
I made a 'fake' website for my application to an apprenticeship as a JavaScript React Developer. <br>
Here are some of its features: <br>
✅ Fully responsive <br>
✅ Navigation bar <br>
✅ Image Carousel <br>
✅ Working Email Form thanks to 'emailjs' service

I really enjoyed making this project and found it to be very fun, even when I ran into some errors. <br>
As for as projects like these go, I am eager to make more of them.
